# EPL Match Result Prediction
---
 In this project I have used an English Premier League Football dataset from (http://football-data.co.uk/) . This is a binary classification problem. The legal sports-betting market in the U.S. was worth an estimated USD270 million in 2017 -- with another USD2.5 billion to USD3 billion in black market betting, according to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC. Even though it is not legalized in many other countries like _India_, but for my own interest, I want to build a predictive model capable of predicting if the home team will win a football match. Usually betting is conducted with human instincts but now we can use some machine learning algorithm to predict the result of the future matches also. There are reports related to sports prediction using machine learning.

 I am a regular viewer of football around the globe, my favorite club is Manchester United and I follow English Premier League religiously and now I am excited I can use my knowledge of machine learning to have some fun with data.

All the code is present the IPython notebook, while you can find the reprt in the .pdf file.

For this project I have installed `xgboost` seperately in Anaconda 3 with Windows 10 OS.
